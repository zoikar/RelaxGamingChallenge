# RelaxGamingChallenge

This is the Read me file for the Relax Gaming Challenge. I've uploaded 2 files that represent each simulation. Each of these files has a main method that runs and prints the outcome of the simulations. There is another file called CombinedGames that gets the output from the 2 games and prints the combined outcome.
